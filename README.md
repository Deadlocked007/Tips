## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

  While creating my tip calculator the biggest hurdle I had to make over was the fact that I have never done any programming
in Objective-C let alone Swift. Thankfully, since I joined the IOS dev club at Purdue I got a lot of help and was able to learn
extremely quickly. Another issue I faced was that I did not have a Mac device to use so I learned how to dual boot OS X on my
devices. I am now the proud owner of dual booting OS X and Windows 10 Surface Pro 3(Woohoo!). Other than that I did not have too
many challenges when building the app due to the extremely helpful resources provided and other sources like stackexchange.com.
